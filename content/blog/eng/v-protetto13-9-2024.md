After the summer break, we’re back with the much-anticipated Venerdì Protetto, a day when work pauses to make room for learning and discussion. During the September edition of Venerdì Protetto, we held a retrospective to gather feedback and ideas on how to make this initiative even more meaningful and engaging. Here’s what we discovered. 


#### Why Venerdì Protetto is important

Venerdì Protetto is an opportunity for our IT department to come together, share knowledge, and cultivate new skills. It is a unique occasion to gain valuable insights into technical approaches and solutions through internal contributions, as well as to learn about other realities through external talks.


#### The retrospective: a moment of listening

Our company is committed to creating an environment where everyone feels heard and valued, and the Venerdì Protetto retrospective represented an important step in that direction. During the retrospective, members of the IT department shared their experiences and suggestions with the goal of improving Venerdì Protetto. Thanks to this collective effort, we gathered valuable feedback on topics, formats, and interaction methods.


#### What will emerge from this initiative?

At Facile.it, every voice matters, and the retrospective on Venerdì Protetto is an example of our commitment to fostering a collaborative work environment. We are already planning initiatives to improve Venerdì Protetto and customize the content based on the feedback collected to ensure that each employee can make the most of these days. We will also continue to gather insights and implement new ideas because innovation stems from listening and collaboration.
