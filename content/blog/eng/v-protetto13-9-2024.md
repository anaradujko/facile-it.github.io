After the summer break, we’re back with the much-anticipated Venerdì Protetto, a day when work pauses to make room for learning and discussion. During the September edition of Venerdì Protetto, we held a retrospective to gather feedback and ideas on how to make this initiative even more meaningful and engaging. 

<br>

#### Why Venerdì Protetto is important

Venerdì Protetto is an opportunity for our IT department to come together, share knowledge, and cultivate new skills. It is a unique occasion to gain valuable insights into technical approaches and solutions through internal contributions, as well as to learn about other realities through external talks.

#### The retrospective: a moment of listening

Our company is committed to creating an environment where everyone feels heard and valued, and the Venerdì Protetto retrospective represented an important step in that direction.

</a>

We took a structured approach during the retrospective and divided the feedback session into topics, such as talks, workshops, and organization. Each topic had a dedicated timebox for suggestions. This approach allowed for greater focus, encouraging the participants to share in-depth insights about single topics. 

Thanks to the collective effort, we were able to gather constructive and valuable feedback and identify areas for improvement.

#### What will emerge from this initiative

At Facile.it, every voice matters, and the retrospective on Venerdì Protetto is an example of our commitment to fostering a collaborative work environment.

</a>

We have begun to outline some ideas for improving Venerdì Protetto in the upcoming year. First, we plan on reserving more space for small talks, allowing the participants to propose problems and share solutions. In addition, we want to pay more attention to the topics suggested by participants so that the discussions are increasingly relevant and engaging. Finally,  we are considering rethinking the workshops to make them more interactive and responsive to the needs of our IT department.

These ideas aim to create a more stimulating learning environment and ensure that each employee can make the most of these days. We will also continue to gather insights and implement new ideas because innovation stems from listening and collaboration.
