In this talk, we discussed the concept of digital twin in the context of an increasingly smart product landscape that is becoming more prominent in our lives. The discussion was enriched with an overview of the architecture of digital twin platforms, focusing on the real-time integration of physical entities with their digital counterparts. We explored key concepts such as digital twin aggregates, lifecycle management, and digital product passport (DPP), as well as the role of distributed systems in terms of scalability, resilience, fault tolerance, and security to ensure stability in complex and data-intensive environments.
