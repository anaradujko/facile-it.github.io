      <description>Introduction During these months at Facile.it I had to face many challenges regarding the improvement of CI/CD pipelines for the Insurance team, with a strong focus on performance and reusability. The focus on these topics is very important as it allows us to follow GitLab best practices for CI/CD such as the fail fast principle.
 ðŸ’¬
Fail fast: On the CI side, devs committing code need to know as quickly as possible if there are issues so they can roll the code back and fix it while itâ€™s fresh in their minds.</description>

      <description>In the last month, I&amp;rsquo;m working on two different PHP projects here at Facile.it: in the first one, which is new and still in development, I decided to adopt GitLab CI for the build, since we use GitLab CE for our Git repositories; I then created a continuous deployment pipeline for the staging environment, directly to a Kubernetes cluster, leveraging Docker Compose to make the configuration easier.
After, I decided to start migrating a previous, internal project of mine to the same approach, since it&amp;rsquo;s currently in production with a dumb approach that provokes some downtime during deployments; on the contrary, doing a rolling deployment with Kubernetes is surprisingly easy!</description>
